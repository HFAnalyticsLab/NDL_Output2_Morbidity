# Networked Data Lab: Morbidity and long-term conditions among those advised to shield from COVID-19

#### Project Status: In progess

## Project Description

- This Networked Data Lab analysis focusses on clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) people, also known as the shielding population - the group of people most at risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 . This group were asked to not leave their homes and to minimise all face-to-face contact up until the end of July 2020 in most of the UK. Whilst the shielding guidance was paused over Summer, people were once again asked to minimise their contact with others from November.

- We are using a federated approach to data analysis and each partner will be contributing the same descriptive analysis based on their local population. These results will then be analysed and aggregated where necessary.

- We will identify long-term conditions by looking back at hospital admission health care records in the period between 1 March 2018 and 29 February 2020. The long-term conditions identified for this analysis are the conditions which comprise the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. In some cases, there may be overlap with the conditions on the
shielded patient list.

- We will aim to identify each of the following conditions by identifying inpatient records that match the relevant ICD-10 cides. In short, an individual is assumed to have had the condition if any record exists during this period matching the relevant ICD-10 codes corresponding to this condition (regardless of whether this was the primary diagnosis). A coding algorithm is set out by [Quan et al (2005)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21764557/).
